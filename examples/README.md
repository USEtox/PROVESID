# Data from PubChem
Everything other than the molecular structures (and related parameters) are to be extracted using PUG View interface. One way to do so is to first download the records (cid and other information) of the compounds for which specific records exist in PubChem from [this page](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/classification/#hid=72). The example in this folder uses extracts `logP` data. Note that it takes around 3 to 4 hours to run this example so the user is advised to limit the number of `CID`s in the loop to a reasonable number (it is more than 18,000 now).
